# TextClassification
The project aims to develop a text classification system designed to categorize responses generated by a chatbot operating in a hospital setting.    To train the model, a pre-existing dataset from the HuggingFace platform, **"vidhikatkoria/DA_MultiWOZ_hospital"**, was used.  The Transformer model used is DistilBERT.
